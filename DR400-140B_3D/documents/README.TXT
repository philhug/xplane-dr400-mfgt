ROBIN DR400-140B (GPL) FOR X-PLANE
==================================
By Cédric Dufour <cedric.dufour@ced-network.net>
(see the licencing section below for licencing details)

Based on the existing HB-KFQ, from the 'Groupe Vol à Moteur (GVM) de Sion'
(Switzerland):
 - 160CV engine
 - Auxiliary fuel tank (set "Fuel XFR" to "L" to transfer to main tank)
 - Working 2D and 3D cockpit, with all instruments required for "at-home"
   training
 - High-resolution (2048x2048) textures (resize to 1024x1024 if experiencing
   GPU performances problems)
 - Customized airfoils
 - Tuned to match real-life experience as closely as possible (in regards with
   weight and balance, performances, and aerodynamical behavior)
 - French and English checklists provided (PDF format, courtesy of GVM; please
   see the CHECKLIST.DISCLAIMER.TXT)
 - Including all "source" files (from/for JavaFoil, XFoil, Blender, Gimp; ~38MB)

TODO:
 - Improve the 3D interior model (pilot, 3D details, better textures, etc.)
 - Improve whatever else needs to
 - Contributors are welcome!


THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMER
=====================

This aircraft does not aim towards being a 100% photo-realistically faithful
model, but rather towards an "operationnally" faithful replica, allowing DR400s
pilots to train "at-home" (practicing their checklist, checking a flight plan
against the plane performances, etc.).

That being said, I hope you will still enjoy it!


INSTALLATION
============

1. Copy this entire folder within X-Plane's folder (ideally within a custom
'Aircraft/My Aircrafts' folder, to prevent X-Plane's Updater to overwrite it)

2. Load the aircraft using X-Plane's standard procedure


FLYING HOWTO
============

Engine start and take-off (shortly put):
> Engine start
- Battery and alternator "on" [lower left corner]
- Mixture "on" (full rich) [lower center red handle]
- Throttle 10-20% [left or right middle handle]
- Magnetos "ign" (then "both") [lower left corner]
- Avionics and lights "on" [top right corner]
> Take-off
- Flaps 15° [press 1x "2" key]
- Trim elevator (white sector) [lower center wheel]
- Trim ailerons [press 20x "0" key; "9" to center, "8" to trim left]
- Release brakes [press "V" key]
- Throttle 100%
- "Lighten the wheel" at 50 knots (IAS)
- "Lift-off" at 60 knots (IAS)
- Initial climb: 70 knots (IAS)
- 1'000ft above ground level (AGL): flaps up [press "1" key]
- Climb: 80 knots (IAS)
- Cruise: 2'400-2'500 RPM

Landing and engine shut-down (shortly put):
> Downwind:
- Speed in "white sector"
- Flaps 15° down [press 1x "2" key]
- Speed 80 knots (IAS)
> Final:
- Flaps 60° down [press 1x "2" key]
- Speed 70 knots + half of head-wind (IAS)
> Runway:
- Throttle 0%
- Flare and land
> Engine shut-down:
- Mixture "off" (full lean) [lower center red handle]
- Magnetos "off" [lower left corner]
- Battery and alternator "off" [lower left corner]

Long story: read and follow the provided checklists! ;-)


DESIGN
======

This aircraft has been created entirely from scratch, based on the author's
experience and knowledge of the Robin DR400, along with information gathered
throughout the documentation (aircraft flight manual, weight and balance
sheet, etc.) of the genuine aircraft, and material publicly available on the
Internet.

The airfoils and their characteristics (lift, drag and moment polars) have
been created using JavaFoil, XFLR5/XFoil and TransFoil (see the acknowledgments
section below for further details). Some "guessing" had to be done concerning
the choice of some profiles, because of the lack of available information
in this regards.
(see the ./source folder for JavaFoil's geometry and XFoil's polar data files)

The aircraft characteristics (cf. X-Plane's Plane-Maker) have been derived
from the aircraft's flight manuals (various versions) and "fine-tuned" (some-
times deviating from the actual value) in order to have the aircraft behave in
X-Plane as closely as possible as in the real life.

The 3D model was created using X-Plane's Plane-Maker and Blender.
(see the ./source folder for Blender's source files)

All textures were created using Gimp, based on pictures from the Robin DR400s
belonging to the 'Groupe Vol à Moteur (GVM) de Sion' (Switzerland).
(see the ./source folder for Gimp's source files)
